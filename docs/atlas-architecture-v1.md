Atlas Architecture v1
Training Operating System
1. Core Thesis
Fitness is not an information problem. It is a translation and execution problem.
Exercise science exists. The failure point is:
Translating science into personalized structure
Adapting that structure to real life
Extracting meaning from historical behavior
Reducing cognitive overhead
Atlas is a stateful training operating system that:
Translates training intent into structured programming
Adapts plans in response to execution and context
Extracts intelligence from longitudinal data
Delegates planning and interpretation burden to the system
AI is not the product.
The system is the product.
AI enhances interpretation and interaction.
2. Architectural Philosophy
Atlas operates on a strict separation:
Deterministic Layer (Non-LLM)
Volume math
Effective set computation
MEV / MAV / MRV logic
% of Goal calculations
Balance ratios
Trend slope calculations
Constraint enforcement
Rescheduling math
This layer is hard-ruled and reproducible.
AI-Assisted Layer (LLM)
Interpretation of ambiguous patterns
Explanation of insights
Suggestion generation within guardrails
Natural language input parsing
Beginner-friendly translation of technical concepts
Behavioral pattern interpretation
AI never performs core volume math.
AI operates within bounded system outputs.
3. Three Core Intelligence Loops (v1)
Loop 1 — Plan Translation Loop
(Day 1 Value)
Purpose:
Convert user intent or imported programming into structured, analyzable training with immediate insight.
Inputs
Goal
Experience level
Schedule constraints
Equipment constraints
Existing plan (manual or parsed)
Deterministic Outputs
Effective sets per muscle (weighted direct / partial / minimal)
% of Goal per muscle (default target = MAV)
Coverage gap detection
Push/pull ratio analysis
Weekly distribution analysis
Frequency checks
AI-Assisted Outputs
Plain-language explanation of insights
Safe plan modifications (within constraints)
Tradeoff explanations
Exercise substitutions respecting constraints
User Experience Outcome
“I understand my plan instantly and know what to fix.”
Loop 2 — Execution-to-Plan Adaptation Loop
(Day 7 Value)
Purpose:
Adapt programming to real-world behavior and performance.
Inputs
Logged sets vs prescribed sets
Missed sessions
Weight/reps deviations
Context events (sick, injury, travel)
Completion rate patterns
Deterministic Outputs
Actual effective sets
Updated % of Goal
Chronic under-MEV detection
Chronic over-MRV detection
Deviation pattern metrics
Candidate rescheduling distributions
AI-Assisted Outputs
Diagnose execution friction (too ambitious, fatigue, time constraint)
Propose bounded adaptations:
Volume redistribution
Deload suggestions
Exercise swaps
Progression rate adjustments
Explain rationale clearly
Autonomy Model (v1)
Low-risk redistributions → autonomous
Structural changes → advisory (one-tap approval)
User Experience Outcome
“I don’t need to fix my plan manually. Atlas adapts.”
Loop 3 — Backwards-Looking Insight Loop
(Day 30+ Value, Retention Driver)
Purpose:
Turn historical data into personalized training intelligence.
This is Atlas’s long-term moat.
Inputs
Effective set history
% of Goal history
Adherence patterns
Lift performance metrics (e1RM proxy or top-set proxy)
Volume bands over time
Session consistency
Deterministic Outputs
Trend slopes (strength, volume)
Consistency metrics
Variance metrics
Weekly recap objects
Response band analysis (basic version in v1)
AI-Assisted Outputs
Personalized insight narratives
Behavioral interpretations
Pattern-based recommendations
Contextual education moments
“Explain my data” conversational interface
User Experience Outcome
“Atlas understands how I respond to training.”
4. Beginner-First Language Layer
Internally:
Mesocycle
MEV / MAV / MRV
Effective sets
Externally:
Phase
Weekly targets
Recovery limit
Balance
Progress trend
Language adapts to experience level.
The system must not require knowledge of exercise science terminology.
5. Guardrails & Safety
AI cannot:
Recommend volume beyond MRV without explicit override flow
Drop muscle groups below MEV without rationale + approval
Alter split structure without advisory step
Remove core compound patterns without user consent
All AI suggestions must originate from structured, deterministic outputs.
6. v1 Scope (Strict)
Atlas v1 must ship with:
Plan Translation Loop
Execution-to-Plan Adaptation Loop
Weekly Recap Insight Object
Deterministic Effective Sets Engine
Advisory adaptation flow
Not required for v1:
Full stall modeling
Wearable integrations
Effort-modulated effective sets
Multi-modality training
Deep response curve modeling
7. Agent Builder Integration Points
Agent Builder should power:
1. Input Parser Agent
Convert unstructured text/photo → structured Plan object
2. Adaptation Agent
Triggered when:
MRV breach
Chronic underdose
Missed session
Injury input
Workflow:
Retrieve structured metrics
Generate bounded options
Return explanation + diff
3. Insight Explanation Agent
Convert structured analytics → human narrative
Handle “Why?” queries conversationally
All agents operate within deterministic system outputs.
8. Monetization Logic
Retention and monetization are driven by:
Longitudinal data accumulation
Personalized insight
Plan adaptation intelligence
Behavioral pattern recognition
Switching cost emerges from:
Historical trend memory
Response band modeling
Custom volume targeting
Learned user preferences
Atlas becomes a training memory system.
9. Product Identity
Atlas is not:
A workout tracker
A chatbot
A program generator
Atlas is:
A training operating system with deterministic science and adaptive intelligence.
